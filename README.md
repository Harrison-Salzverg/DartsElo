# DartsElo
Creating an Elo system for our local Darts matches/tournaments.

The Aim with this project is to creating a functional Elo system similar to one which can be found in games such as chess and Go for Darts.
The product must be easy to use and accessible for non technical users for use in our local darts matches which take place during our tournaments.

The doubles functionality is based on getting an average elo of the two players on each team, performing the elo adjustment calculation based on these averages and applying the elo gain/loss to each player individually

The excel to CSV change was made in anticipation of a further update to a database system later once a deployment decision has been made.
